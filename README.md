Here are three features for my donation campaign project:

1. **Category-based Donations:**
   - Categorize donation campaigns into health, food, clothing, and education.
   - Allow users to browse and select campaigns based on their preferred causes.

2. **Interactive Campaign Details:**
   - Provide detailed information about each campaign, including pictures, descriptions, and donation goals.
   - Enable users to click on a campaign to view its full details.

3. **Dynamic Pie Chart Statistics:**
   - Create a dynamic pie chart in the Statistics section that shows the distribution of donations.
   - Highlight the user's contributions ("Your Donation") and the total donations received ("Total Donation") in the chart.
